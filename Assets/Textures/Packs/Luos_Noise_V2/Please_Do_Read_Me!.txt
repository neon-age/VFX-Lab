Gee, you'd think I'd really like the name Luos.
(I do!)

Enjoy and be sure to show me any awesomesauce you make with this!


Legal:
Use it in whatever you want, games, art, print it out and use it as a wallpaper, or burn it in a ritual expression of how much you dislike these noise patterns!
Dont claim you made them, you didnt.
You are allowed to modify them and/or use them as a base to create something new.
Just dont make them into a marketplace pack (on whatever store) and sell them.
If you need one or two textures for your marketplace package then you are allowed to do so.
Anything else? you can always ask!

If you legally are Jan Kaluza AND friends with me on at least one kind of social media you can do whatever you want with them regardless of this legal mumbo jumbo :p

Cheers!
